# common-colors

This package will scan through the CSS/LESS/SASS files in a repo and return statistics on your color usage. Telling you your most common one and eventually displaying more information as well.

## List of future features:
- Command line interfaces that prints out information about color use (good for quick use and CI)
- GUI that will show an indepth breakdown around color usage
- Maybe begin making suggestions around too many colors, where some are "primary" or "secondary" etc.
- Be able to analyze more than just CCS/LESS/SASS files
- Support all the different color definition types (rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, exact words)
